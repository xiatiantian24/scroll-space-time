        <p class="text-content prelude divider">In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that
          a
          planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, against the
          German line at Serre-Montauban, scheduled for July 24, 1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the
          29th. He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance. The
          following deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the
          Tsingtao Hochschule, casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing.

        <p class="text-content divider">. . . and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in
          German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our
          work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His
          being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the
          same risk. Madden was implacable.
          Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable. An Irishman in the service of England, a man
          suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this
          extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany?

      </div>
      <div class="text-container trans3DText level-2">
        <p class="text-content divider">I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the door. I
          threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. The never changing rooftops filled the window,
          and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or
          omens, might be that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a child
          in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container trans3DText level-3">
        <p class="text-content divider">Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century follows
          century, and things happen only in the present. There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and
          all that really happens happens to me . . . The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end
          to these wandering thoughts.

      <div class="text-container trans3DText level-4">
        <p class="text-content divider">
          In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak of terror, now that I have
          outwitted Richard Madden, now that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose), I knew that the fast-moving and
          doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of the exact site of the new
          British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and, absently, I turned it into an
          airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of France, shattering the artillery park under a rain
          of bombs. If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that
          it could be heard in Germany . . . My voice, my human voice, was weak. How could it reach the ear of the
          Chief? The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except that we were in
          Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his 2 arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking
          in vain for news from us. I said aloud, "I must flee."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container trans3DText level-5">
        <p class="text-content divider">I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering
          at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets.
          I found just what I knew I was going to find. The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin,
          the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I
          decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single shillings and some
          pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and
          weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great
          distance. In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person
          capabl of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container trans3DText level-6">
        <p class="text-content divider"> I
          am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky plan to an end. It was not
          easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a
          barbarous country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy.
          Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did not speak with
          him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.

          I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. The
          train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine.
          There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages. I remember some farmers, a woman
          dressed in mourning, a youth deep in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.

          At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length
          of the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the
          seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container trans3DText level-7">
        <p class="text-content divider">I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of
          those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could
          save his armies. Besides, I had to escape the Captain. His hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and
          beckon at my door.

          Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a
          look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent
          to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized. The truth is that, in the
          deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of
          the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.

      </div>
      <div class="text-container trans3DText level-8">
        <p class="text-content divider">From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that
          the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary in his first
          attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate. I argued that so small a victory
          prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was 3 not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident
          of the train schedule, I would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous
          happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion. From my weakness
          I drew strength that never left me.</p>
